\cChapter{Tätigkeitsprotokoll}

Dies ist die möglicherweise unvollständige Auflistung der Tätigkeiten, beginnend mit dem 31. Oktober 2003 -- also kurz nach der Umstellung auf die neuen Intel Server.
Arbeiten vor diesem Datum sind nicht mehr in der Liste, und wurden auch nirgends richtig dokumentiert. Die Arbeiten wären z.B. Erstellung des LDAP Baumes, Import der Benutzer, Kampf mit dem OpenLDAP Server, Beginn des Web-Interfaces und Erstellung des iLogin Clients in C.
